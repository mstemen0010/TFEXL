TFEXL (2048 Experimental)


A JavaFx version and algorithm test-bed of the popular 2048 game

Event though 2048 has been wildly popular, there seems to be an over contigent of the more "hardcore" 
gamers/designers that is it not a game but instead a puzzle. After playing a lot of different versions 
of the original game (most of the spin offs follow a lot of the original design that was... lets face it
,created in a weekend) This version will allow for an open end in the game engine that will allow
trying different variaions in the rule set that will hopefully turn it into the game that I can feel is truely
there (example of this would be the rules of tile promotion and where those tiles spawn--utimately no matter were 
the player is in the expontial progression they are creating, the new replacement tiles always follow the same
scheme of spawning and starting value (2 or 4 seems to be a constant in the versions I have played) this may be the 
problem. 

The tile behavior will be handled by an event system that will allow the rule set of the game to be fluid and 
changable.
